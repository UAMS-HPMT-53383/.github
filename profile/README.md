## HPMT 53383 - Introduction to Natural Language Processing 

### Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on methods for using, understanding, and analyzing unstructured data in the form of natural language text. 
This course trains students to understand NLP theory, techniques, and tools, with particular focus on applications and research in the areas of public health and healthcare data analytics. 
In addition to learning in lectures and assigned readings about both foundations and current cutting-edge NLP approaches, students will put this knowledge into immediate practice in weekly hands-on exercises implemented in R.  
As the semester progresses each student will plan and implement a final project that demonstrates their ability to apply one or more advanced natural language processing techniques to analysis of textual data in an area of interest to the student.
